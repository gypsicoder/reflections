When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to backup my work in online and when many people can work on the same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because automatic pull may create conflicts and discard my current changes.
