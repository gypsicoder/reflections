How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It has reduced the amount of texts to compare where difference were which eventually helped to find the bug quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It will reduce headaches about wrong changes. We can get back the previous correct codes from history easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: Manual save will make the history not so small or not so big. And the history will be meaningful.
Cons: Manual saves is dependent on the user. So if user forget to save it may cause problem.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because those platforms provide version control for different purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

We have to run the commands in terminal by reciding on the git repository.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It will give full confidence because I can get back to previous working version easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to see what difficulties we may face and how to get rid off using git.
