What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a directory named .git. We need it to track history of the files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a subset of working directory. Staging area define which files we want to update in repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add the changes to staging area and compare with the last commit. If okay then I can commit the staging area.
